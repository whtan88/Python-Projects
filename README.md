# Python-Projects
A repository for python codes and mini-projects which I have worked on. Generally on data analysis/visualisation and machine learning.

Currently I am starting out to put my codes along with the relevant dataset here, so I will try to organize and link the relevant dataset to the codes to make it easy to follow.

Below is a list of various projects which I will be engaging on, and will update them accordingly when I have completed them.
